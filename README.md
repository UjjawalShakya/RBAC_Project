# RBAC System
A Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System implemented in ReactJS to manage user roles and permissions effectively. This project allows users to sign up, log in, and view their role-based access. Admin users can manage other users by toggling roles or deleting them, while viewers have restricted access.

### Admin Dashboard:

- Toggle user roles (Admin <-> Viewer).
- Delete users from the system.
### Viewer Dashboard:
